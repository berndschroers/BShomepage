I am Professor of Matter and Motion in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. My research area is mathematical physics, particularly geometric and solitonic models of matter and quantum gravity in three dimensions. For details have a look at my publications, and those of my current and past research students. I am a founding member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Physics Group [EMPG](https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk) and the North British Mathematical Physics Seminars [NBMPS](https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk/NBMPS/).



Mathematics in Edinburgh
======
Currently, I am also the Head of the School of Mathematics at Edinburgh, one of the largest departments of mathematics in the UK and worldwide. The International Centre for Mathematical Sciences [ICMS](https://www.icms.org.uk) and the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt Universty [MACS](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm) further add to the intersest of Edinburgh as a home for mathematicians. Mathematical research and PhD training at the Universty of Edinburgh and at Heriot-Watt University are pooled in the [Maxwell Institute](https://www.maxwell.ac.uk)

AIMS
======
When not in Edinburgh I am often in South Africa, Ghana or Rwanda in connection with the African Institutes for Mathematical Sciences [AIMS](https://nexteinstein.org) there.


**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
